# Outfolio Clojure

This is a rewrite of the small web app [Outfolio](https://github.com/nicolashery/outfolio).

Also see [Oufolio Clojure Dev Blog](https://github.com/nicolashery/outfolio-clj-devblog).

## Quick start

You will need Java, MongoDB 2.6, and [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) installed.

In a separate terminal, start MongoDB with:

```bash
$ mongod
```

Start the app with:

```bash
$ lein run
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
